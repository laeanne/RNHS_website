            <h1>EVENTS</h1>
            <p1>Hey there! I just wanted to share about the fantastic Valentine's Day event we had at Rosales National High School. This year, our school celebrated Valentine's Day with a special twist, thanks to our entrepreneur class project. We got the chance to set up our own booths and showcase our entrepreneurial skills, and it was such a blast!

                The whole event was organized by the Supreme Secondary Learner Government, and they did an amazing job of creating a fun and festive atmosphere. Everyone in the school participated by wearing color-coded shirts to show their Valentine's Day status, which made the day even more vibrant and engaging.
                
                As part of our entrepreneur project, we set up various booths selling all sorts of Valentine-themed goodies. There were booths offering delicious treats like cupcakes, chocolates, and heart-shaped cookies. Some booths had handmade crafts like personalized cards, candles, and friendship bracelets. It was really cool to see everyone's creativity and hard work pay off.
                
                Our booth was a hit! We decided to sell custom-made flower bouquets and chocolate gift sets. We spent days preparing and decorating our booth to make it look attractive and inviting. When the big day came, we were excited (and a little nervous) to see how our products would do. Luckily, we got a lot of positive feedback, and our sales were through the roof!</p1><br><br>
